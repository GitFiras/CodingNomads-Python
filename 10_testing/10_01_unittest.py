'''
Demonstrate your knowledge of unittest by first creating a function with input parameters and a return value.

Once you have a function, write at least two tests for the function that use various assertions. The
test should pass.

Also include a test that does not pass.

inp = input("Provide number: ")
def calc():
    res = inp * 100
    print(res)
    return res

# test to pass
# test to not pass
